# PROJECT: TIC TAC TOE

### Brief Introduction
In this fourth repository from The Odin Project Full Stack JavaScript curriculum under the JavaScript course, I will make a Tic Tac Toe game that can play in the browser using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

### Learning goal
- To have as little global code as possible
- Tucking everything away inside of an IIFE module pattern or factory function
